            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In 2009, the first form of cryptocurrency was created with "Bitcoin". Crypto assets use blockchain 
                technology, a type of digital ledger, to record all transactions across a large network of computers. 
                Crypto is usually 'mined' with its input resources usually being large amounts of computational power. 
                This differs from traditional currencies such as the USD, Euro, or stock assets as crypto is disconnected 
                from any government entity or centralized bank. These coins hold little physical value, but work similarly 
                to traditional stocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now in 2025, thousands of cryptocurrencies have been created, each with its own valuation and branding. 
                Prices fluctuate throughout the day, and savvy investors may be able to capitalize at higher returns than 
                traditional shares purchased on the NASDAQ. Our project aims to compare the 2 investments, traditional 
                stock and the newer cryptocurrencies, and determine the pros and cons to each. We hope to examine 
                volatility, average returns on investment, and visualize the many different types of coins and companies. 
                We believe cryptocurrency is the future of investment, and believe the topic is extremely important with 
                growing concerns in the U.S stock markets.

                        This chart shows a treemap visualization comparing the market capitalization of various stocks and cryptocurrencies.
                        Each rectangle represents an individual asset, with the size of the rectangle corresponding to its market cap.
                        The color coding differentiates between stocks (yellow) and cryptocurrencies (pink). From the visualization,
                        we can see that while traditional stocks dominate in terms of market capitalization, certain cryptocurrencies 
                        like Bitcoin and Ethereum also hold significant market value. This highlights the growing importance of cryptocurrencies
                        in the financial landscape, despite being a relatively new asset class compared to established stocks.

                        This visualization illustrates how the stock market behaves on a day-to-day basis by tracking the average percent 
                        change of stock prices over time. When viewed across multiple months, the chart reveals that most daily changes remain 
                        clustered close to zero, meaning that the market tends to move gradually rather than through extreme daily swings. The few 
                        noticeable spikes and dips correspond to periods of unusual volatility—likely earnings releases, macroeconomic news, or shifts 
                        in investor sentiment—which briefly disrupt the otherwise stable trend. The interactive time filters (1W, 2W, 1M, All) allow 
                        users to zoom into shorter windows and uncover short-term patterns, such as momentum surges, brief pullbacks, or stabilization 
                        phases. Together, these insights help contextualize how dynamic the market is, making it easier for viewers to understand whether 
                        recent price movements are typical fluctuations or indicators of emerging trends.

                        This line plot highlights the performance of stocks across different industries. It shows the average 
                        trading price each day plotted across an entire date range. The visualization also includes all Cryptocurrencys 
                        aggregated as a comparison line to all stocks and subsections of stock. When plotting all industries against Crypto, 
                        results vary widely. When looking at this years data, only a single industry outperformed being Consumer Defensive stocks. 
                        Despite success within each industry, the entire weighed average still falls below Crypto gains for most categorys. Our visualization 
                        can break down these categorys further into subsectors. This allows for more detailed comparison and showcases a few niche sectors that 
                        outperform Crypto greatly. Home Furnishing & Banking lead these categorys at 80-90 percent cumulative gains. Our visualization helps uncover
                        specific market trends that show behavior across specific sector and industires, highlighting recent and long term changes.

                        Across both charts, April's market behavior shows a stark divide between traditional stocks and cryptocurrencies. 
                        The stock movers display a tight cluster of modest changes, with most companies shifting less than 1% in either 
                        direction—highlighting the stability and predictability of the equity market during this period. In contrast, the 
                        crypto-only chart reveals dramatic volatility, with many tokens experiencing explosive gains ranging from 30% to over 200%. 
                        This huge spread underscores crypto's highly speculative nature and its sensitivity to short-term sentiment and momentum. Viewed 
                        together, the visualizations emphasize how stocks and cryptocurrencies operate on entirely different volatility scales, with equities 
                        moving gradually while crypto assets can swing wildly within the same timeframe.

                        This bubble plot highlights the relationship between price, average percent change, and trading 
                        volume across the most actively traded stocks and cryptocurrencies over the past 30 days. The 
                        visualization makes the differences between the two asset classes immediately apparent: cryptocurrencies 
                        exhibit much wider variation in both price and volatility, forming a dispersed cloud of points across the chart. 
                        Stocks, on the other hand, cluster tightly around lower levels of average percent change, demonstrating far more 
                        stability in their monthly performance. Larger bubbles—representing higher trading volume—help viewers pinpoint which assets 
                        are driving market activity, showing that some extremely volatile crypto assets also receive substantial trading attention. By 
                        combining three dimensions of data into a single chart, this visualization uncovers patterns that would be harder to detect when 
                        viewing these variables separately, making it clear how volatility and market behavior differ dramatically between stocks and crypto.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                In conclusion, our analysis of cryptocurrencies and traditional stocks reveals distinct characteristics 
                and investment potentials for each asset class. Cryptocurrencies offer high volatility and the possibility 
                of significant returns, appealing to risk-tolerant investors. However, they also come with regulatory 
                uncertainties and security concerns. On the other hand, traditional stocks provide more stability and are 
                backed by established companies, making them a safer choice for conservative investors. Our visualizations 
                highlighted these differences, showcasing the rapid price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies compared to the 
                steadier growth of stocks. Ultimately, the choice between investing in cryptocurrencies or traditional stocks 
                depends on individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and market outlook.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using recent data, we also found that aggregate cryptocurrency has generally outperformed common stocks since
                the initial tariffs in April. This confirms our hypothesis that since crypto is not a taxable good, it would
                feel less impact from Trump's changes. We also noticed that Crypto tracks the market. It follows the general
                flow of the S&P 500 and even closer with the technology sector. While this may be a short term
                coincidence, the correlation is strong and suggests investors value both types of assets.

                Future Plans: To improve our process we can examine larger time frames surrounding major market events. 
                By examining the different in cryptocurrency performance during highly volatile times, we can see if the blockchain 
                assets really are safer investments when the global economy enters limbo. Further, we can make more visualizations to 
                compare different types of coins. Crypto is a broad category and there are many different types that can be compared just like stocks. 
                With these comparisons we hope to make a fuller picture of crypto and common stock markets for new investors.
