            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In 2009, the first form of cryptocurrency was created with "Bitcoin". Crypto assets use blockchain 
                technology, a type of digital ledger, to record all transactions across a large network of computers. 
                Crypto is usually 'mined' with its input resources usually being large amounts of computational power. 
                This differs from traditional currencies such as the USD, Euro, or stock assets as crypto is disconnected 
                from any government entity or centralized bank. These coins hold little physical value, but work similarly 
                to traditional stocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now in 2025, thousands of cryptocurrencies have been created, each with its own valuation and branding. 
                Prices fluctuate throughout the day, and savvy investors may be able to capitalize at higher returns than 
                traditional shares purchased on the NASDAQ. Our project aims to compare the 2 investments, traditional 
                stock and the newer cryptocurrencies, and determine the pros and cons to each. We hope to examine 
                volatility, average returns on investment, and visualize the many different types of coins and companies. 
                We believe cryptocurrency is the future of investment, and believe the topic is extremely important with 
                growing concerns in the U.S stock markets.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                In conclusion, our analysis of cryptocurrencies and traditional stocks reveals distinct characteristics 
                and investment potentials for each asset class. Cryptocurrencies offer high volatility and the possibility 
                of significant returns, appealing to risk-tolerant investors. However, they also come with regulatory 
                uncertainties and security concerns. On the other hand, traditional stocks provide more stability and are 
                backed by established companies, making them a safer choice for conservative investors. Our visualizations 
                highlighted these differences, showcasing the rapid price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies compared to the 
                steadier growth of stocks. Ultimately, the choice between investing in cryptocurrencies or traditional stocks 
                depends on individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and market outlook.

                Using recent data, we also found that aggregate cryptocurrency has generally outperformed common stocks since
                the initial tariffs in April. This confirms our hypothesis that since crypto is not a taxable good, it would
                feel less impact from Trump's changes. We also noticed that Crypto tracks the market. It follows the general
                flow of the S&P 500 and even closer with the technology sector. While this may be a short term
                coincidence, the correlation is strong and suggests investors value both types of assets.

                Future Plans: To improve our process we can examine larger time frames surrounding major market events.
                By examining the different in cryptocurrency performance during highly volatile times, we can see
                if the blockchain assets really are safer investments when the global economy enters limbo. Further,
                we can make more visualizations to compare different types of coins. Crypto is a broad category and 
                there are many different types that can be compared just like stocks. With these comparisons we hope to
                make a fuller picture of crypto and common stock markets for new investors.
